## Description 

This application uses MySQL, Sequelize, NodeJS, and handlebars to create an app that allows the user to input custom burger names and to allow them to be identified as either "eaten" or "not eaten. After the submission, burgers are stored in a database where we utilized Mysql and jawsDB to eventually deploy an app where data can be utilized in a CRUD application.
